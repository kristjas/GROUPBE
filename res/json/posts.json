It would be great to find a convenient spot to play regularly. Additionally, I'm looking to form a basketball friend group. If anyone is interested in joining, please let me know! We can organize some friendly matches and maybe even set up a regular schedule. All skill levels are welcome, so don't worry if you're just starting out or haven't played in a while.",
